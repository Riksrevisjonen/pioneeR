# pioneeR 0.5.0

## Breaking changes

- Results for the Malmquist index are now returned ala Farrell (not Shephard). This is consistent with how results
for other models are currently presented in the app. Users should note that this changes the interpretation of the malmquist index for input-oriented models. See `?compute_malmquist()` for details. (#81)
- Removed the select input box for returns to scale in the Malmquist analysis tab. The currently supported Malmquist index is the one defined by FÃ¤re & Grosskopf (1996). Components of the index is thus always computed based on the same returns to scale (either CRS or VRS depending on the specific component), so the select input box is not needed.
- `runPioneeR()` has been removed to avoid confusion for new users with the release on CRAN.

## Enhancements

- Added a new exported function, `compute_malmquist()` for calculating productivity. This also removes the need for `{productivity}` as a dependency. (#81)
- Further sub-components of the Malmquist index, including bias technical change and scale efficiency change, have been added to the results in the Malmquist analysis tab. (#81)
- Added caching to the bootstrap function in the app (#88)
- A warning is now generated if the power of the analysis is too low and more DMUs should be added for robust results (#83)

# pioneeR 0.4.0

## Added stochastic frontier analysis

- Using the BFGS algoritme in the optim funcion of R we fit the stochastic frontier model.
- The following code now runs on my mac

library(pioneeR)
data(riceProdPhil, package = 'frontier')
rice <- sfa( log( PROD ) ~ log(AREA) + log( LABOR ) + log( NPK ),
             data = riceProdPhil, productivity = TRUE )
rice$coef


## Breaking changes

- pioneeR now depends on bslib 0.6.0 or higher (#73)
- `summary_tbl_dea()` no longer supports `Farell`-type objects from the `{Benchmarking}` package (#104)

## Changes & improvements

- Updated documentation for `run_pioneer()`
- Added a new package logo (#21)
- Added custom functions for DEA calculations in order to remove `{Benchmarking}` as a dependency (#80)
- Added new exported functions for calculating, and bootstraping DEA models, `compute_dea()` and `bootstrap_dea()` (#80, #93)
- All R functions - including `server()` and `ui()` - have been moved to the `R` directory with benefits to how internal functions are accessed. In addition, the global environment is untouched when the app is run (#87)

## Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug where the checkbox for timeseries would be available before any data is uploaded (#74)
- Fixed a few bugs where the UI did not correctly reflect the user supplied input for rounding (#84)

# pioneeR 0.3.0

## Breaking changes

- pioneeR now depends on bslib 0.5.1 or higher. Version 0.6.0 or higher is recommended, and support for version 0.5.1 will be deprecated in the next release

## New features

- Added new boostrap functionality for models with constant or variable returns to scale based on Simar and Wilson (1998) (#6)
- Added new function `unset_env_vars()` that will clear environment variables set by pioneeR if the app exits unexpectedly and the variables are not unset automatically
- Added new function `compute_scale_efficiency()` to run CRS, VRS and NIRS models to compute scale efficiency and evaluate optimal scale size for each unit
- Added new function `summary_tbl_dea()` to create a summary table of efficiency scores from a vector of efficiency scores or an object of type Farrell as returned from the `dea()` function in the Benchmarking package
- Added new helper function `create_matrix()` that will create a matrix of input values or output values based on a data.frame

## Improvements

- Layout changed to `layout_sidebar()` from the bslib package to improve UI and fix compatability with bslib >= 0.6.0 and Boostrap 5.3 (#44)
- Analysis report has been updated and simplified to make the results from the app easier to reproduce (#35)
- `runPioneeR()` has been renamed `run_pioneer()`. `runPioneeR()` will still work, but will be deprecated in a later version
- Improvements to the user interface and user experience (#57)
- For time series data, all columns are now available to select as year/time variable. If a column with values within the range \[1900, 2100\] exists, this column will automatically be selected (#41)

## Bug fixes

- If the user selects a port number that is considered unsafe, a random port number is selected instead (#40)
- Fixed a bug where an error occurred if any of the model parameters were not found in the column names (#39)
- Fixed a bug in the scale efficiency tab where numbers where rounded twice (#47)
- Fixed a bug that would block Excel-files from properly uploading (#71)

# pioneeR 0.2.0

- Added ability to provide data to the app with `runPioneer()`
- Added the ability to return data when the app closes
- Fixed a bug where the Malmquist tab would not show the results of the analysis (#36)

# pioneeR 0.1.0

- First public release
